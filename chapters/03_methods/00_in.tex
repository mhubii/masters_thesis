\label{sec::3_me}
While there is an extensive guide on the installation of the implemented software within the appendix \ref{sec::A_si}, the purpose of this chapter is to give the future reader a good understanding of it. The code itself was written to be generic, such that it is not dependent on the used robot at all, for why it is very well suited to perform future research on arbitrary humanoid robots with. Therefore, the reader will be given a broad overview of the overall code's structure in section \ref{sec::31_cs}, in order to allow for a fast assessment of possibly reusable implementations. The completely decoupled pattern generation and deep learning parts of the software are hence explained first in section \ref{sec::32_pg}, and section \ref{sec::33_dl}, respectively. Following that, the particular communication with our humanoid robot will be explained in section \ref{sec::34_co}.
