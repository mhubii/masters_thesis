\section{Depth Map Parameter Tuning}
\label{sec::52_dm}
Within this section, we shortly explore the effects of all tunable parameters on the depth map generation. Therefore, we utilize a simple experimental setup, which is shown in figure \ref{fig::52_wls_setup}.

	\label{fig::52_wls_setup}
\end{figure}
Within the setup, Heicub points its stereo camera towards three chairs that are located at a distance of $1\,\text{m}$ towards each other, and towards the cameras, so to cover close, medium, and far distances. The consecutive chairs are slightly shifted, in order to enable the simultaneous observation of all of them. The rectified view of the environment is shown in figure \ref{fig::52_wls_rgb}.
