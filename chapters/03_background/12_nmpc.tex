\subsection{Nonlinear Model Predictive Control}
\label{sec::312_nmpc}
At the heart of nonlinear model predictive control stands sequential quadratic programming. Before we come to the actual problem formulation, we need to understand how sequential quadratic programming can be used to solve nonlinear optimization problems. We will then come to recognize that if we can find a canonical formulation of our problem, it will become possible to apply sequential quadratic programming to it. The next paragraph - Sequential Quadratic Programming, will therefore shortly introduce the reader to the desired method that will be used to solve the  nonlinear optimization problem, while the subsequent paragraph - Canonical Formulation of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control, will then explain how to fit humanoid walking into this framework.
