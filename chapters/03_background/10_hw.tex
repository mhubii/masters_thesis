\section{Humanoid Walking}
\label{sec::31_hw}
To get started with and to understand the presented concepts that generate dynamically balanced walking trajectories we shall have a look at figure \ref{fig::3_cl} once more. The chapter at hand - Humanoid Walking, explains the building blocks that together make up the pattern generation within the control loop (orange box).
