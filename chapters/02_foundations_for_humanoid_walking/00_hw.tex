The generation of dynamically balanced walking trajectories for humanoid robots requires to cover several posed challenges. Within this chapter, all of the concepts which are used throughout this thesis will be explained, starting from the zero moment point, which is the used balance criterion, in section \ref{sec::21_zmp}. How the zero moment point can be used to set up a sequential quadratic problem for the generation of balanced center of mass trajectories will subsequently be introduced in section \ref{sec::22_nmpc}. The resulting positions and orientations for the center of mass and the feet will then be interpolated by polynomials that are explained in section \ref{sec::23_it}. Finally, the inverse kinematics that are used to convert the center of mass trajectories into joints angles are covered in section \ref{sec::241_fk}, together with the forward kinematics that can be used to generate center of mass feedback.
